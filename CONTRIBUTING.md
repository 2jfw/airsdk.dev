### Submit a guide or tutorial 

Currently the AIR platform is in desparate need of a documentation refresh. This site aims to do that, providing the basis for a community driven documentation site.

All the tutorials and guides are written in standard markdown so if you have time to create something, please feel free and either send it to us or submit a pull request.
