Although imported images and artwork are important, the functionality known as the drawing API, which allows you to draw lines and shapes in ActionScript, gives you the freedom to start an application with the computer equivalent of a blank canvas, on which you can create whatever images you wish. The ability to create your own graphics opens up broad possibilities for your applications. With the techniques covered here you can create a drawing program, make animated, interactive art, or programmatically create your own user interface elements, among many possibilities.
